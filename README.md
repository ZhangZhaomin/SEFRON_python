# SERFON_python
This project base the paper-'SEFRON: A New Spiking Neuron Model With Time-Varying Synaptic Efficacy Function for Pattern Classification'published by abee.
The whole project was wirtten by python3,it includes 2 codes and  2 sorts of data sets which named iris and wbc(all of them can get from uci website easily),you can train the SNN model and test it via running the main function,if you want to train other data sets,just change  hyperparameters.
Reference paper and abee's source codes were cited from follow website:

Thanks for abee's selfless help.
